# Deep Learning for Indoor Pedestal Fan Blade Inspection

## Overview

This project leverages deep learning techniques and autonomous drones for the inspection of indoor pedestal fan blades, aiming to provide an educational platform for students in the Electrical and Computer Engineering fields. Utilizing small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (sUAVs), this project simulates the inspection of wind turbines using scaled-down fans to significantly reduce costs, risks, and logistical complexities, enabling feasible and safe on-campus experiments. Students engage in hands-on applications of Python programming, computer vision, and machine learning algorithms to detect and classify simulated defects in Pedestal Fan Blade (PFB) images.
