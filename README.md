# Computer Vision-Based Path-Planning with Indoor Low-Cost Autonomous Drones: An Educational Surrogate Project for Autonomous Wind Farm Navigation

## Authors

## Institution
Utah Valley University - College of Engineering & Technology

## Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for the project titled "Computer Vision-Based Path-Planning with Indoor Low-Cost Autonomous Drones: An Educational Surrogate Project for Autonomous Wind Farm Navigation." This project is designed to provide an educational platform for undergraduate students in the Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) fields by using small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (sUAVs) to surrogate the inspection of wind turbines. By employing scaled-down fans as stand-ins for actual turbines, the project significantly reduces costs, risks, and logistical complexities, making feasible and safe on-campus experiments.

## Project Structure
The project is divided into two main sections:
1. **Path-Planning**: This directory contains all the scripts and resources related to the path-planning algorithms used in the project.
2. **Deep Learning**: This directory includes the deep learning models and training scripts utilized for enhancing the drone's navigation capabilities.

Each section has its own README files that provide detailed explanations of the files and their functions.

## Acknowledgements
The branch was developed by Mr. Angel Rodriguez, an ECE student at Utah Valley University (UVU), under the supervision of Dr. Mohammad Shekaramiz.
